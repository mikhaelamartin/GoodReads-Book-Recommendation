These include:\n\n    **1. Weighted-Scoring/Popularity-Based:**\n\n    All books receive a score from 1 to 5 that takes into account their average rating and number of ratings given. Books that have a higher score are deemed more \"popular\" and are more likely to be recommended to the user.\n\n    **2. Content-Based Filtering:**\n\n    The system heavily relies on item attributes such as book summary, author, tags, date published, etc. to recommend books similar to ones the user has read already. \n\n    **3. Collaborative Filtering:**\n\n    This method is based on the belief that people like things that are similar to what they already like and things that people who are similar to them also like. There are a couple types of collaborative filtering and methods to go about implementing it, but we will delve into it later on.\n    \n\n### Table of Contents:\n#### 1. Data Collection\n#### 2.

Popularity-Based Filtering**\n\n### 4.1 Description\n\nPopularity Based Filtering is a recommendation system that suggests the most \"popular\" items. User preferences are not taken into account; instead, recommendations are based on a ranking or score that utilizes item attributes (i.e. watch time, ratings, number of purchases). It is important to note that this algorithm recommends the same content to every consumer. Some examples of this type of system include the Youtube Trending and Twitter News.\n\n### 4.2 Pros and Cons\n\n#### Pros:\n - Fixes cold start issues: If a user is a new user who has limited to no history, recommending trending products (as opposed to a random assortment) increases the chance of the user clicking on or purchasing products.\n \n- Easy to code: Doesn't require complex algorithms to implement. \n\n#### Cons:\n - Not Personalized: Every user is being offered the same products. This method takes no consideration  what the customer's tastes and preferences are.\n\n### 4.3 Methodology\n   For this project, popularity is based on a weighted ranking formula that considers a book's average rating, total number of votes, mean rating across the dataset, and minimum number of votes for the book to be listed in the top 10% of books.

The tags table consists of 34253 possible unique tags that can be assigned to a book. The book_tags table lists out the top 100 tags associated with each book and their count.

In order to compute the TF-IDF value (for each word-book combination), two metrics are multiplied toegether: (1) how often a word occurs in a tag-list and (2) the inverse document frequency of the word across the entire collection of tag lists.\n\nThe TFIDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the tag list for the book in question. The TFIDF value decreases when a word is commonly found in other tag lists, alluding to the conclusion that the word is not important to that book in particular.\n\n#### **Term Frequency**\nThe higher the term frequency, the more times the word is found in that specific tag list. The lower the term frequency, the less times the word is found in that specific tag list. \n$$ TF = \\frac{a}{b} $$\nwhere:\n\nTF = Term Frequency\n\na = Number of times word is included in the tag list\n\nb = Number of words in tag list (could be more than 30 if a tag is comprised of more than one word)\n\n#### **Inverse Document Frequency**\nMeasures how common or rare a word is across every tag list. The closer this value is to 0, the more common a word is; the closer this value is to 1, the less common a word is.\n$$ IDF = log(\\frac{c}{d})$$\nwhere:\n\nIDF = Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\nc = Number of books\n\nd = Number of books containing specific word\n\n#### TF-IDF Score\nThe higher the score, the more descriptive the word is for that specific book.

We do this by calculating their cosine similarity. \n\nMathematically, Cosine similarity is a metric that measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. In our case, each vector represents all of the TF-IDF scores of each word for a given book. The cosine similarity score between two books measures how similar they are to each other. \n\n#### Why cosine distance?\nThe cosine simiilarity takes into account the direction of the books and not the magnitude. Even if one book is better described as \"action\" than another, despite both having a low \"romance\" score, our algorithm should still recommend both books to the user if they prefer action. These two points have a large Euclidean distance, but their cosine distance is relatively small, so they are deemed more similar.  \n\nLet's say the TF-IDF score for the word \"comedy\" for book A is 5 and the score for book B is 4. This means that book A is slightly more comedic than book B. If user 1 has read book A, then the recommendation system has a high chance of recommending book B.

This is true especially when there is a large amount of data because finding similar people is easier in comparison to a small dataset. Overall, a large training dataset leads to better recommendations. Additionally, the amount of testing data does not need to be needlessly big to achieve a decent outcome.\n\n### Why use item-based collaborative filtering over user-based collaborative filtering?¶\n\n- First, the system may perform poorly when there are far more items than ratings. This is also known as a cold start, where the user is new and has not yet engaged with the system enough (through purchases, ratings, clicks, etc.) for the model to find people with similar tastes. This terminology can also be expanded to the whole system in which everyone is new and the whole system fails to provide optimal recommendations using item-based CF.\n- In general, there are usually much less items than people, so a 2d matrix mapping similar items will be much smaller than a 2d matrix mapping similar people. This decrease in space makes computing similarity scores much faster and takes up less resources to store.\n- Another reason user-based collaborative filtering is used is because user tastes may change, so what they may have liked before will not be beneficial to predicting what they will like now or in the future. Items are more static than individuals - a student may take a statistics course in the fall one semester and purchase statistics textbooks, but may take economics in the spring and not want statistics books to be recommended. On the other hand, a statistics textbook will always stay a statistics textbook. People's tastes will almost always change throughout the duration of their lifetime, so their similarity scores with other people will always be changing.\n\n\n## Memory Based Collaborative Filtering Pros and Cons\n\n#### Pros\n- Easy toimplement.\n- More accurate than content-based filtering.\n\n#### Cons\n- Sparsity in data. When the percentage of pele who rate items is low, this method is less accurate and predictive of what people will like and dislike. This is especially true for users who are new (cold start) and have not yet rated enough items for the system to be optimal. Similarly, if there is only one person who has rated two items and liked them both, then the model thinks these items are similar.\n- Scalability. The more people there are in the system, the more memory and space are needed to compute the nearest neighbors.\n\n\n## 2. Model Based Approach:\n\nModel-based Collaborative Filtering is based on matrix factorization (MF) which is an unsupervised learning approach that seeks to find underlying variables known as latent factors to predict the unknown ratings. In our case, we will use Single Value Decomposition (SVD).\n\n**How does SVD work?**\n\nWhen the user-item matrix is sparse in relation to its size, use SVD to represent the matrix in two lower ranking matrices. The first matrix has rows containing users and columns representing latent factors that are unknown to you but capture the preferences of the users. These factors could represent how much the user likes comedy, how much the length of the book comes in to play, etc. The second matrix contains rows of the latent features and the columns which represent the book. Similarly, the latent feature represents how comedic a book is, the length of the book, etc. When multiplied, these matrices impute missing entries in the original matrix."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we split our ratings data into two sets: train and set.

When an item is not yet rated or hasn't been rated by many users, the system is less likely to give weight to it and will not be recommended.\n\nOverall, the best approach would be to use a combination of different methods. A mix of collaborative and content-based filtering will produce the best predictive power in which both the preferences of the users and contents of the items are weighted.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
